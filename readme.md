#  AirScanAI: Aerial Threat Detection Dashboard

**AirScanAI** is a real-time simulation tool that combines radar data and computer vision to detect and track aerial objects such as drones and UAVs. It mimics the type of multi-sensor threat detection used in defense systems like those built by DRDO labs (ADE, ADRDE, CABS, etc.).

##  Features

-  Simulated radar signal tracking using a CSV dataset  
-  Live object detection using webcam (OpenCV)  
-  Sensor fusion with Kalman Filter for accurate tracking  
-  Interactive dashboard built with Streamlit

##  Getting Started

### Step 1: Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

### Step 2: Run the main simulation

```bash
python main.py
```

### Step 3: Launch the Streamlit dashboard

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/streamlit_app.py
```

> Ensure `radar_mock.csv` is present in the `data/` folder before starting.
